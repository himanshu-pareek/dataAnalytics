We can further visualize data using plot\n\n```{r group sample_iris by Species}\nplot (\n    cars$speed,\n    cars$mean_dist,\n    main = \"Car meandist v/s speed\",\n    xlab = \"Speed of car\",\n    ylab = \"Mean distance\"\n)\n```\n\n \nWe can see that relation between mean distance and speed is approximately linear\n",
